# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer churn using a telecom dataset to identify key factors influencing customer attrition. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, and actionable insights for improving customer retention.

## Key Findings

*   **Churn Rate:** 26.54% of customers in the dataset have churned.
*   **Senior Citizens:** A higher percentage of senior citizens churn compared to non-senior citizens.
*   **Tenure:** Customers with shorter tenures (1-2 months) are more likely to churn.
*   **Contract Type:** Customers with month-to-month contracts (55.02% of contracts) exhibit higher churn rates.
*   **Payment Method:** Customers using electronic checks as their payment method are more prone to churn.
*   **Service Usage:** Customers lacking value-added services like Online Security, Tech Support, and Online Backup have significantly higher churn rates. Fiber optic users also show a higher churn rate compared to DSL.

## Code and Libraries

The analysis was performed using Python and the following libraries:

*   NumPy
*   Pandas
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is "Customer churn.csv," which includes customer demographics, service usage, and churn status.
